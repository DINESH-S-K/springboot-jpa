#This repository takes you through the relationships between Entities.
#Generally the relations are more effective between tables in the database. 
#Here the entity classes are treated as relational tables (concept of JPA), therefore the relationships between Entity classes are as follows:
#(Both unidirectional and Bidirectional)
#@ManyToOne Relation
#@OneToMany Relation
#@OneToOne Relation
#@ManyToMany Relation
