### Springboot JPA Relationships

This repository takes you through the relationships between Entities.
Generally the relations are more effective between tables in the database.
Here the entity classes are treated as relational tables (concept of JPA), therefore the relationships between Entity classes are as follows:<br>
(Both unidirectional and Bidirectional)
* @ManyToOne Relation
* @OneToMany Relation
* @OneToOne Relation
* @ManyToMany Relation
